# Integer Overflow Bug in Hack

This repository demonstrates a subtle integer overflow bug in Hack code.  The functions `foo` and `bar` appear simple, but under certain conditions, they produce incorrect results due to integer overflow. The `main` function demonstrates a scenario where this occurs, resulting in the program producing an unexpected output.  The solution shows how to modify the functions to handle potential overflow more robustly.
